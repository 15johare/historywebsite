  <h2>What is archeaology</h2>

  <p>Archeaology is the study of what has been left behind by people from the past.
    Archeaologists dig up the ground to find clues left by our ancestors. These can 
    vary between bones and objects people have made. The man-made objects they find are 
    called artefacts. These include jewllery, pottery, tools, weapons and buildings.
